-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the partner data API for Kardia.  If you are not
    already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API system,
    please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read "API.txt"
    in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/partner

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/partner?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the partner data API:

	of partners, or even permission to view a particular partner or any
	partners at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.
