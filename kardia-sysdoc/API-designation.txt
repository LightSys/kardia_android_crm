-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the gift designation data API for Kardia.  If you
    are not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.

    The purpose of this API is to provide access to gift information in a
    fund-specific context.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/designation

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/designation?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the designation data API:

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds -- list of gift designations (funds)

	Please note that you may not have permission to view the entire list
	of designations, or even permission to view a particular fund or
	any funds at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.

	Example REST queries:

	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection
	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=basic

	Objects in this collection have the same properties as the specific
	elements shown in the next item below.

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname} -- information about one fund
    (designation):

	This URL would be an element, not a collection.  It will have the
	following properties:

	    name	    - combined id of fund and ledger
	    fund            - id of the fund
	    ledger     	    - id of the accounting ledger the fund belongs to
	    fund_desc       - a short description of the fund
	    ledger_desc	    - a short description of the accounting ledger
	    subfund_list    - a comma-separated list of all subfunds that
			      belong to this fund (including this fund itself)

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Gifts -- List of all gifts
    given to the particular fund, including gifts given to sub-funds.

	This is a collection URL.  Each Gift object returned will have the
	following properties:

	    gift_date	    - date of gift
	    gift_amount	    - monetary amount of the gift
	    gift_fund	    - id of fund donated to
	    gift_ledger	    - ledger id of fund donated to
	    gift_fund_desc  - description of fund donated to
	    gift_ledger_desc- description of ledger
	    gift_check_num  - check number of gift
	    gift_type	    - type of gift (Check, Credit Card, etc.)
	    gift_receipt_num- receipt number sent for the gift
	    gift_non_tax_ded- 0 of tax deductible, 1 if not tax deductible
	    donor	    - the name of the donor
	    donor_id	    - the ID of the donor
	    donor_address   - the current mailing address of the donor

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Years -- a list of all years
    in which gifts were given to the fund (or to its subfunds):

	Objects in this collection URL will have the following properties:

	    year	    - the numeric year

	    first_gift_date - the first date a gift was given in the year
	    last_gift_date  - the last date a gift was given in the year

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Years/{year}/Gifts -- a list
    of all gifts given to the fund (and subfunds) in the given year.

	The objects in this collection URL will have the same properties as
	objects in the non-year-specific collection URL.

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Years/{year}/Periods -- a
    list of accounting periods in the given year (whether or not those periods
    have gifts in them to this fund or subfunds):

	This is a collection URL.  Properties:

	    name	    - combined id of period and accounting ledger
	    period    	    - id of the period, such as "2014.01"
	    period_desc     - description of the period
	    ref_period	    - the reference period (usually January of the year)

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Subfunds/{fundname}/Gifts
    -- List of all gifts given to the particular fund.

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Subfunds/{fundname}/Years
    -- a list of all years in which gifts were given to the fund.

	Objects in this collection URL will have the same properties as the
	non-subfund Years collection.

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Subfunds/{fundname}/Years/{year}/Gifts
    -- a list of all gifts given to the fund in the given year.

	objects in the equivalent non-subfund Gifts collection URL.

    /apps/kardia/api/designation/Funds/{fundname}/Subfunds/{fundname}/Years/{year}/Periods
    -- a list of accounting periods in the given year (whether or not those
    periods have gifts in them to this fund):
