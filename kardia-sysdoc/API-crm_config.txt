-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the CRM configuration data API for Kardia.  If you
    are not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.

    If you are looking for data used for the CRM engagement data itself, such
    as a list of tracks that one partner has engaged in (as opposed to a list
    of all available engagement tracks), see the "API-crm.txt" document.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/crm_config/

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/crm_config?cx__mode=rest
