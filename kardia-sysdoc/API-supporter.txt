-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the simple supporter data API for Kardia.  If you
    are not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/supporter

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/supporter?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the supporter data API:

    /apps/kardia/api/supporter -- list of supporters in the system

	Please note that you may not have permission to view the entire list
	of supporters, or even permission to view a particular supporter or any supporters
	at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.

	Example REST queries:

	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/supporter/?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection
	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/supporter/?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=basic

    /apps/kardia/api/supporter/{supporterid}/Prayers -- Information about the
    prayers that the supporter has done (clicked 'i prayed' in an app, for
    example).

	This URL is a collection, and will contain objects with the following
	properties:

	    prayedfor_id    - the ID of the "prayed for you" record
