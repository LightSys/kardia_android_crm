-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the fund manager data API for Kardia.  If you are
    not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/fundmanager

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/fundmanager?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the fund manager data API:

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager -- list of Fund Managers

	Please note that you may not have permission to view the entire list
	of fund managers, or even permission to view a particular manager or
	any managers at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.

	Example REST queries:

	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/fundmanager?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection
	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/fundmanager?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=basic

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager/{partnerid} -- information about one fund
    manager:

	This URL would be an element, not a collection.  It will have the
	following properties:

	    manager_id	    - id of the partner managing the funds
	    manager_name    - first and last name (or org. name) of the
			      partner
	    fund_cnt	    - number of funds that this partner manages

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager/{partnerid}/Funds -- List of all primary
    funds that this partner manages.  Note that some funds are broken down
    into sub-funds; the sub-funds are not shown separately here.

	This is a collection URL.  Each Address object returned will have the
	following properties:

	    name	    - combined id of fund and ledger
	    fund            - id of the fund
	    ledger     	    - id of the accounting ledger the fund belongs to
	    fund_desc       - a short description of the fund
	    ledger_desc	    - a short description of the accounting ledger
	    fund_class	    - a description of the class of the fund
	    subfund_list    - a comma-separated list of all subfunds that
			      belong to this fund (including this fund itself)

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager/{partnerid}/Funds/{fundname}/Periods -- List
    of accounting periods for this fund during the last three to four years.
    Normally there is one accounting period per month.

	This is a collection URL.  Each Contact object returned will have the
	following properties:

	    name	    - combined id of period and accounting ledger
	    period    	    - id of the period, such as "2014.01"
	    period_desc     - description of the period
	    ref_period	    - the reference period (usually January of the year)

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager/{partnerid}/Funds/{fundname}/Periods/{periodname}/Balances
    -- The starting and ending balances for the particular fund (with all
    subfunds rolled in) in that period.

	This is an element URL, not a collection.  The Balances object will
	have the following properties:

	    start_balance   - the balance in the fund when the period opens.
			      Note that this number will be negative when the
			      fund has a positive balance in it, and vice
			      versa.
	    balance	    - the current (or ending) balance for the fund in
			      that particular period.

    /apps/kardia/api/fundmanager/{partnerid}/Funds/{fundname}/Periods/{periodname}/Transactions
    -- A list of transactions for the fund (including all subfunds) which
    occurred in the given period.

	This is a collection URL.  Properties are:

	    debit	    - the debit amount of the transaction.
	    credit	    - the credit amount of the transaction.
	    fund	    - the specific fund (could be a sub fund).

	    comments	    - comments associated with the transaction
	    to_from_id	    - the partner id that the transaction is
			      associated with (for instance, if the
			      transaction is a payment, this is who the
			      payment was sent to)
