Document:   Kardia REST API for CRM Data
Author:	    Greg Beeley (GRB)
Date:	    26-Jun-2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the CRM (engagement) data API for Kardia.  If you
    are not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.

    If you are looking for data used for the CRM system configuration, such as
    a list of available engagement tracks (as opposed to a list of tracks that
    one partner has engaged in), see the "API-crm_config.txt" document.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/crm/

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/crm?cx__mode=rest
