-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the simple missionary data API for Kardia.  If you
    are not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/missionary

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/missionary?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the missionary data API:

    /apps/kardia/api/missionary -- list of missionaries in the system

	missionaries, or even permission to view a particular missionary or any
	missionaries at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.
