OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the simple donor data API for Kardia.  If you are
    not already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API
    system, please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read
    "API.txt" in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/donor

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/donor?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    The following are example paths to various types of collections of objects
    in the donor data API:

    /apps/kardia/api/donor -- list of donors in the system

	Please note that you may not have permission to view the entire list
	of donors, or even permission to view a particular donor or any donors
	at all.  This is determined by the Kardia system itself.

	Example REST queries:

	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/donor/?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection
	    http://server/apps/kardia/api/donor/?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=basic

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/GivingInfo -- Information about places
    or sub-entities within the organization to give to.  There will in most
    cases just be one such entity within the organization; this is not a list
    of available funds.

	This URL is a collection, and will contain objects with the following
	properties:

	    giving_url	    - general URL to use to donate online
	    giving_ledger   - ledger ID of this entity
	    giving_ledger_desc - description of the entity

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/DonorInfo -- Information about one donor

	This URL would be an element, not a collection.  It will have the
	following properties:

	    donor_name	    - first and last name (or org. name) of the donor
	    donor_address   - mailing address of the donor

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Gifts -- List of all gifts a donor has
    given

	This is a collection URL.  Each Gift object returned will have the
	following properties:

	    gift_date	    - date of gift
	    gift_amount	    - monetary amount of the gift
	    gift_fund	    - id of fund donated to
	    gift_ledger	    - ledger id of fund donated to
	    gift_fund_desc  - description of fund donated to
	    gift_ledger_desc- description of ledger
	    gift_check_num  - check number of gift
	    gift_type	    - type of gift (Check, Credit Card, etc.)
	    gift_receipt_num- receipt number sent for the gift
	    gift_non_tax_ded- 0 of tax deductible, 1 if not tax deductible

	Please note that the 'fundid' used in later URL's here includes both
	the id of the fund and the id of the ledger, separated by a vertical
	bar '|'.  For example, if the fund is '1000' and the ledger is 'DEMO',
	the fundid used in URLs later in this document would be '1000|DEMO'.

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Funds -- List of all funds the donor has
    given to

	This is a collection URL.  Each Fund object has these properties:

	    fund	    - fund id
	    ledger	    - ledger id
	    fund_desc	    - description of fund
	    ledger_desc	    - description of ledger
	    gift_count	    - number of gifts given
	    gift_total	    - total amount given
	    recent_gift_date- date of most recent gift
	    giving_url	    - URL to use to donate online to this fund

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Years -- List of all years in which the
    donor has given a gift

	This is a collection URL.  Each Year object has these properties:

	    year	    - number of the year, such as 2012.
	    gift_count	    - number of gifts given
	    gift_total	    - total amount given
	    first_gift_date - date of first gift during the year
	    last_gift_date  - date of most recent gift during the year

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Funds/{fundid}/Gifts -- List of all gifts
    given to the particular fund

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Funds/{fundid}/Years -- List of all years
    in which the donor gave to a particular fund

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Funds/{fundid}/Years/{year}/Gifts -- List
    of all gifts given to a particular fund in a given year

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Years/{year}/Gifts -- List of all gifts 
    given during a particular year

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Years/{year}/Funds -- List of all funds
    given to in a particular year

    /apps/kardia/api/donor/{donorid}/Years/{year}/Funds/{fundid}/Gifts -- List
    of all gifts given to a particular fund in a given year
